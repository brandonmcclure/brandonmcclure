- 👋 Hi, I'm @brandonmcclure
- 👀 Developing locally, the future is human centric and federated.
- 🌱 I am daily refining my IaC with [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) and [OpenTofu](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu). [Golang](https://github.com/golang/go) and [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir) are my languages of choice right now. Kubernetes is cool but it does not address human problems, change my mind.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on transit tools (GTFS-RT, fleet tracking/management and general operations of public transit system), as well as projects that advance smart grid tech.

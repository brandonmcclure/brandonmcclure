- 👋 Hi, I'm @brandonmcclure
- 👀 I'm interested in building local resilience by continuing my tool making heritage.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning [elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir), [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), and practicing automation with [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) and [terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform).
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on transit tools (GTFS-RT, fleet tracking/management and general operations of public transit system), as well as projects that push smart grid tech.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Mastadon](https://hachyderm.io/@bmcclure) [github](https://github.com/brandonmcclure), [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/brandonmcclure) or at [linkdin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-mcclure-4b332332/).
